If you're root on your device, you can follow this method to become device owner.

First, create a file device_owner.xml with following content:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes" ?>
<device-owner package="your.owner.app.package.id" name="Your app name" />

Now do the following steps

    adb push device_owner.xml /sdcard/

    adb shell

    su

    cp /sdcard/device_owner.xml /data/system/

    cd /data/system/

    chown system:system device_owner.xml

    reboot
